# FindCopNum
This is an app used to find the minimum cop number to cover a tree. 
Currently it is in development. 
Functionality completed: 
	1. Random Tree generation
	2. Display tree
	3. Read a tree from a file and destinate a root
	4. Print Reverse
The start up file is start.py

Assignment 1: 
	The start up file is start.py
	Functions:
		1. Generates using queue to store nodes to be branched. 
		2. Drawing is done using pygraph, matplotlib, and graphviz where graphviz arrange the node positions in a tree-like fasion and the matplotlib displays the tree. 


Assignment 2:
	The start up file for assignment 2 is ass2CLI.py
	It prompts user for instruction and can generate, read from file, and print reverse using dfs. 
		1. Tree generation is improved uppon the first assignment where it now utilizes the built in networkx function to generate the random tree as the generation is no the focus of this assignment. 
		2. Read file uses the json file generated by the generation function. User can modify the data in json format according to their needs. It then uses networkx built-in function to convert it from json to tree. 
		3. Print reverse is done with depth-first-search algorithm.
